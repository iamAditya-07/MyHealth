# MyHealth
This is a website related to mental health awareness. Users can visit here and listen music, read alleviating blogs, attend meditation sessions and also connect with experts for the betterment of their mental health.

The goal of mental health awareness is to help people with mental illnesses understand that they are not alone in their strugglesâ€”and that getting treatment can make all the difference. If we applied this approach to mental health every day of the year, more and more people could benefit from knowing about these common illnesses.

The inspiration comes from helping people all around the world by finding their symptoms, providing treatment and facilities and and perhaps most importantly, break the mental health stigma that leaves so many people suffering in secret.

This is the home page of my website.
